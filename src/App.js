/** <> </> that wrap the Gallery and About components. Can you imagine what these are and what they might be for? They are called React fragmentsâ€”a shorthand abbreviation for <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>.

They're a useful tool in React to allow multiple elements to be grouped together. Although in JSX you can only return a single parent element, this rule can be satisfied by wrapping the children components in a React fragment. This also allows you to wrap elements without creating extra DOM nodes, like wrapping with a <div> would do.  */
